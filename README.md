This is the first videogame code I ever created.
It may seem like Ruby, but it's actually my own language - the language of pain.
Please don't judge me, I had no idea what I was doing.

If by any means you want to try it out, but the .exe file doesn't work for you or you use something aside from Windows, you can execute the source code.
In order to do so:
1) Install a recent Ruby interpreter from the official website: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ (or the one that was recent back in 2018-2019).
2) Install Gosu library: https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki.
3) Download the file 'tmg.rb' and folder 'vis' (with all the very important stuff inside) from this repo and put them into one folder.
4) Open the folder containing 'tmg.rb' and 'vis' via the command line/terminal and enter the command "ruby tmg.rb" to execute the code.

There is nothing much to say about the game itself. Just take care of the pets. Sometimes they will try to talk to you.
